# DS440

In an effort to simplify stock selection, our DS 440 project will attempt to create a composite index grade for each stock. Then, a front-end dashboard will be created, with the top-performaning (and worst-performing) stocks shown, along with a link to FINVIZ for each stock, to allow the user to gain more information about a stock. Top-performing stocks are those with the highest composite index grades, with the opposite being true for worst-performing stocks.
